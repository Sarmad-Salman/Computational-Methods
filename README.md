# Computational-Methods


Finding the perfect step size for the maximum level of robustness and effectiveness in finding the true root of any given problem utlizing the local parallel pool of the system i.e., hardware accelerated problem solving with advanced root finding algorithms that deliver results in fractions of a second as opposed to the basic biesction method.
